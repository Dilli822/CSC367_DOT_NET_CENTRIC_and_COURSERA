Supervised Learning Algorithms

- Correct Answer is known
- labelled datas input and output
- prediction is modtly correct
- Supervised Algorithms is mostly used in business level application 

 mapping from x to y 
input 'x'             output 'y'                        application
email   --->          spam?                             spam filter
audio ----->          text transcripts                  speech recognition
english ---->         spanish/nepali                    machine translation
ad, user info ->      click                             online ads
image, radar info --> position of the cars              self-driving cars
image defect          defect?                           computer vision

Not only the  straight line (fitting line) but also the route line can be better 
for housing price prediction
a curve or straight line more relevant and closer to the datasets can be considered as 
the desired output. i.e. regression that task is to predict the outcomes or number
Regression Algorithm gives the output number i.e. from the infinitely possible numbers.


--- Classification Algorithm -----
--- health - breast cancer detection as an example of classification problem
suppose there are two types of cancer 
1. malignant - 0
2. benign - 1

In classification we have class and category and category could have classes.

we could have n number of input and n number of output in regression problem.

In summary Supervised learning Algorithms
1. Regression - predict the number, infinitely from the possible numbers
2. Classification - predict categories, small number of possible outputs
