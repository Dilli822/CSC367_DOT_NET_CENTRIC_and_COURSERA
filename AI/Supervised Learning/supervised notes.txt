Supervised Learning Algorithms

- Correct Answer is known
- labelled datas input and output
- prediction is modtly correct
- Supervised Algorithms is mostly used in business level application 

 mapping from x to y 
input 'x'             output 'y'                        application
email   --->          spam?                             spam filter
audio ----->          text transcripts                  speech recognition
english ---->         spanish/nepali                    machine translation
ad, user info ->      click                             online ads
image, radar info --> position of the cars              self-driving cars
image defect          defect?                           computer vision

Not only the  straight line (fitting line) but also the route line can be better 
for housing price prediction
a curve or straight line more relevant and closer to the datasets can be considered as 
the desired output. i.e. regression that task is to predict the outcomes or number
