-- unsupervised learning Algorithm
- although name is unsupervised it is powerful as Supervised
- it has no labelled training data and is not Supervised, Algorithm learns without any guidance
- examples of unsupervised learning are 
    1. Clustering

Clustering:
  it is the process of grouping the groups into a clusters of similar features, attributes and characteristics.
  For an example if we have 
---------------------------------------------
| Person            | DNA Group |
|-------------------|-----------|
| John Doe          | Group A   |
| Sarah Lee         | Group C   |
| Robert Martinez   | Group D   |
| Samantha White    | Group E   |
| Emily Smith       | Group A   |
| David Brown       | Group C   |
| Lisa Anderson     | Group D   |
| Kevin Rodriguez   | Group E   |
| Michael Johnson   | Group A   |
| Jennifer Taylor   | Group C   |
| William Garcia    | Group D   |
| Amanda Wilson     | Group E   |
| Jane Smith        | Group B   |
| Alex Johnson      | Group B   |
| Mary Brown        | Group B   |

then from the above table we can cluster the persons based on the groups.

- Application of unsupervised learning is at the Google News 
for an example if I do searching as Raining Season and Rainy Countries in the world
the the possile newsheadlines can be 

"Heavy Rains Forecasted as Raining Season Approaches in Tropical Regions"
"Top 10 Rainiest Countries: Where Rainfall Dominates Year-round"
"Preparing for the Raining Season: Tips for Flood Prevention and Safety"
"Climate Change Impact: How Rainy Countries Are Adapting to Extreme Weather"
"Exploring Rainy Season Tourism: Destinations for Nature Lovers and Adventurers"
"The Science Behind Raining Season: Understanding Weather Patterns and Forecasting"
"Raining Season Health Risks: Addressing Waterborne Diseases and Hygiene"
"From Drought to Deluge: Rainy Countries' Strategies for Water Management"
"Cultural Traditions During Raining Season: Celebrations and Festivals Around the Globe"
"Economic Impacts of Raining Season: Agriculture, Tourism, and Infrastructure Challenges"

-- if we carefully study and observer the patterns in the topics of the newsheadlines then the word 
rains, Raining, Season, rainy are mostly repeated so that indirectly means our UNSUPERVISED LEARNING Algorithm
Cluster the similar words or similar types of news after collecting the news from the internet.
